Loss it seems is the worst kind of sorrow
Loss of dreams, the dreams of tomorrow

Loss of the moments you two should have shared
Loss of opportunities to show her you cared

Loss of the memories you both could have created
Loss of the romance once intense as you dated

Loss of a kiss, caress, or embrace
Loss of that special feeling no one else can replace

Loss of a look, the twinkle in her eye
Loss of the touch as you pass each other by

Loss of a future, from a past of regret
Loss of a last chance, how many do you get

Loss of a promise you never meant to break
Loss of two hearts that forever will ache
